.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model corresponds 
to the .NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries). 

Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable 
that the two concepts would be confused. However it is important to understand that they are two very 
different things.The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.
